# SonarQube LLM Assistant
Verifying SonarQube reports with LLM

Use is simple:
- insert the correct variables in the "variables.py" file;
- run the "execute.py" file.

The execution will create two files:
- "conversationLog.txt": contains all the answers generated by the LLM in all the conversations;
- "log.json": contains tuples with Hotspot IDs and the related result given by the LLM, with a possible solution in case of a real risk.
