# SonarQube LLM Assistant
Verifying SonarQube Security Hotspots and Vulnerabilities reports with LLM.

Use is simple:
- insert the correct variables in the "variables.py" file;
- run the "executeHS.py" file (Security Hotspots) or the "executeV.py" (Vulnerabilities).

The execution will create two files:
- "conversationsLog_Hotspots/Vulnerabilities.txt": contains all the answers generated by the LLM in all the conversations;
- "logHotspots/Vulnerabilities.json": contains tuples with Hotspot IDs and the related result given by the LLM, with a possible solution in case of a real risk.

Tests are currently happening to improve the process.
